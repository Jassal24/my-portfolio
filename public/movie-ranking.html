<p>This is my favorite Chinese Drama, it has a lot of situational scene and 
    for last and most the plot twist of the story is very touching and amazing.</p>
<h3>Encounter</h3>

<p>I really love this Korean Drama I've watched it over and over when i'm in a agony mood but 
    i want you all to watch this one because it has a lot of painful scene out here.</p>
<h3>After</h3>

<p>This is an Hollywood movie that make me realize how love must go on
    eventhough it's hard to find your truly yours, if you wanted someone you 
    will risk everthing to be with her unti the end, Yeah there's a lot of struggles in a relationship wherein 
    both of the partners must be encountering some misunderstanding but be optimisitic what your situation is 
    and be understandable..
